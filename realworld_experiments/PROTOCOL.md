Everyday:
- refill acetone
- refill surfactant
- refill oil
- refill water


For each experimental condition and run:
- clean the petri_dish and oil tube on the sink with acetone and water
- run all 1000 experiments
- from the 1000 xp, select 10 that are far apart in the behavior space, using the specified algorithm, run 10x each experiment as a baseline for testing the model and assess stochasticity
- only then switch the next experiment and clean everything

Three conditions:
- random_params
- random_goal
- interest_tree

Three run each
